# Lethal Jumpany and Facility Dash for the PintoBoy
### Adds a new scrap item that lets you play different minigames while you adventure.

<i> “Introducing the PintoBoy! Try to beat the highscore in these accurate depictions of what an employee goes through on the job! Device and Software all releasing on December 20th, ‘89!”<br></i> 
is what was written on an old poster advertising the system.

Sadly, production of this “training software” was stopped by the Company after the first wave distracted employees on the job so much that they had to be let go before making a profit.

Some units can still be found in facilities scattered around the solar system.
