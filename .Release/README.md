# Lethal Jumpany for the PintoBoy
### Adds a new scrap item that lets you play a minigame while you adventure.

<i> “Introducing Lethal Jumpany! Try to beat the highscore in this accurate depiction of what an employee goes through on the job! Releasing for the PintoBoy on December 20th, ‘89!”<br></i> 
is what was written on an old poster advertising the game.

Sadly, production of this “training software” was stopped by the Company after the first wave distracted employees on the job so much that they had to be let go before making a profit.

Some units can still be found in facilities scattered around the solar system.
